Key Features to Implement

- Load Balancing Algorithm: Implement different algorithms like round-robin, least connections, or IP hash to distribute 
traffic among backend servers.

- Health Checks: Regularly check the health of backend servers to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy instances.
Implement both active (pinging servers) and passive (monitoring responses) health checks.

- SSL Termination: Handle SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer to offload encryption/decryption tasks from the backend
servers. Use libraries like OpenSSL to manage certificates and encryption.

- Routing Rules: Implement host-based and path-based routing to direct traffic to the correct backend server based on the 
request's host or URL path. Use regular expressions or predefined rules to match requests.

- Session Persistence: Implement sticky sessions to ensure a user's requests are consistently routed to the same backend 
server, which can be important for stateful applications.

- Logging and Monitoring: Log requests and responses for debugging and monitoring purposes. Integrate with logging and 
monitoring tools to track the performance and health of your load balancer.

- High Availability: Distribute traffic across multiple instances of your load balancer to ensure high availability and 
fault tolerance. Implement failover mechanisms to handle the failure of load balancer instances.
