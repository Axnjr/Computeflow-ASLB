# **What is computeflow ?**
My small ambitious personal project. Its a cheaper alternative to Render and other AWS wrappers. ðŸ¤ž <br>
Due to [AWS Service-quota Limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) I can't just use there LB, so I made my very own ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™

# **Contributing**
Would really appreciate your PR's for improving it and help especially for docker ðŸ˜…. I just don't have enough time to research and fix this shit: 
```
mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019: failed to resolve source metadata for mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019: no match for platform in manifest: not found 
```
